      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my Web Site! A Little About Me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a recent Computer Science graduate with a passion for data. I have always firmly believed that anyone who utilises and understands the importance of data has a great advantage over others. Today I am a data science intern at TEG Analytics and mainly work in the Healthcare Insurance domain. I am a member of the Product Development Team where we constantly trying to build new data products that derive value and insights for our clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m excited about taking new challenges as a Data scientist or Business Analyst. Though I am passionate about this domain, I also love to read books and travel from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
