      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was around the third week of January 2019 and just at the right time where our New Year Resolution energy were still pretty much present. My roommate and me had taken part in several hackathons before this and we had never reached close to the finishing line in any one of them. After completing several courses in data science it was frustrating to not see any results during these competitions. It was then my roommate had found a hackathon in a newly developed Indian based competition or hackathon website known as Machine Hack. The title of this hackathon is what you see in the title of this article. It was a fresh start, a new hackathon where we would try our best again and hopefully get somewhere closer than our previous attempts. The deadline of the hackathon was in a weeks time and we had one week to make something happen. There was a holiday right before the weekend and we intended to utilise every oppurtunity that we can get.&lt;/p&gt;
